### Hi, I'm [@uppercod](https://twitter.com/uppercod), creator of Atomico and I want to thank you for starting with Atomico.

Now what you have installed is a quick start kit based on Vite, which you can scale for your project, now to continue you must execute the following commands:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm start` : Initialize the development server
3. `npm build` : Optional, Generate a build of your project from the html file [index.html](index.html).

## Todo with TSX(Typescript)

This is a small Todo created with Atomico that will allow you to know how it is with TSX(Typescript), I hope that with these examples you will understand:

1. **Create components with effects on forms**: it is normal that when starting with webcomponents you cannot reflect your events to forms, in this example I show you how to solve this in an elegant way.
2. **Design token**: The design tokens are the variables of a design system, in this example I show you how to carry the token design in a sustainable way and without global conflicts.
3. **Bases for developing components and applications with Atomico**: although the example is a small whole, with the use of Atomico types, communication through events and the use of forms.
